from [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study] k
join [dbo].[Order_Status] s
on k.Order_ID=s.Order_ID
group by Customer_Name, Customer_Segment, [Status]
order by Customer_Segment

I got the list of customers that returned items, and the segment they belong by Joining the two (2) tables given; KMS Sql Case Study and Order_Status

#### 11.	If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer
```
SELECT Order_Priority, Ship_Mode, COUNT(*) AS Order_Count, SUM(Shipping_Cost) AS Total_Shipping_Cost
FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
GROUP BY Order_Priority, Ship_Mode
ORDER BY Order_Priority, Ship_Mode
```
**üöö Business Insight: The company do not appropriately on shipping cost because the larger percentage of their orders were delivered through regular air regardless of the order priority. The company ought to deliver their orders through express and regular air, only if the order priority is either critical or high.**
